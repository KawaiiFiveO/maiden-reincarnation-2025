        <h2>A. The Debutante Dilemma</h2>
        <div class="limits">Time limit per test: 2 seconds<br>Memory limit per test: 1024 megabytes</div>
      
        <p>In the royal capital of Eorka, the grand Spring Ball is being held at the Imperial Palace. This ball marks the debut of noble ladies into high society. Every eligible noble family sends exactly one daughter (unless they're scandalous enough not to).</p>
        <p>Penelope, the villainess (but totally misunderstood), has received a guest list with the names of the debutantes. However, she suspects that some commoners might have snuck in by faking noble names. Unacceptable!</p>
        <p>In Eorka, <strong>noble names are always unique</strong> — no two debutantes should share the same name. If there are any duplicates, the palace guards will start investigating.</p>
        <p>Can you help Penelope determine if the list is <em>valid</em> (all names are unique) or <em>scandalous</em> (there are duplicates)?</p>
      
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line contains a single integer \( n \) \((1 ≤ n ≤ 100)\), the number of debutantes.</p>
        <p>The next \( n \) lines each contain a single string \( s_i \) — the name of the \( i \)-th debutante. Each name is a string of lowercase English letters, length between 1 and 20.</p>
      
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>Print <code>Valid</code> if all names are unique. Otherwise, print <code>Scandalous</code>.</p>
      
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p><strong>Input</strong></p>
        <pre>5
evelyne
beatrice
yuri
beatrice
sophia
</pre>
      
        <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
        <pre>Scandalous</pre>
        <p><strong>Input</strong></p>
        <pre>6
isabelle
victoria
noelle
shuli
katalina
penelope
</pre>
      
        <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
        <pre>Valid</pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>In the first example, <em>Beatrice</em> is listed twice — how dare she show up twice?! So the list is scandalous. In the second example, everyone's name is unique, so the list is valid.</p>

        <p>Rosalite discovers that she's stuck in a time loop. Every time her brother, Asterion, dies, she gets sent back to the same point in time!</p>
        <p>She keeps a journal to track how many things she does each loop. The journal records her <strong>task counts</strong> for every loop.</p>
        <p>After \( n \) loops, she wants to know: On how many loops did she do <strong>strictly more tasks</strong> than the previous loop?</p>
      
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line contains a single integer \( n \) \((2 ≤ n ≤ 1000)\).</p>
        <p>The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \), where \( a_i \) is the number of tasks she completed on the \( i \)-th loop. \((0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4)\)</p>
      
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>Print a single integer: the number of loops where \( a_i > a_{i-1} \).</p>

        <h2>C. Kidnapping the Male Lead</h2>
        <div class="limits">Time limit per test: 2 seconds<br>Memory limit per test: 1024 megabytes</div>
      
        <p>Vivian got into a carriage accident and suddenly remembers <em>everything</em>: her future death, the demon's rise, and worst of all — the only clue about the male lead:</p>
        <p><strong>He was the most handsome man in the empire.</strong></p>
        
        <p>That's it. No name. No birthmark. No tragic backstory. Just "handsome."</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for her, this world is absolutely <em>infested</em> with hot men.</p>
        <p>Determined to fix the plot, Vivian begins kidnapping the most handsome men she encounters, one by one, hoping to find the real male lead.</p>
        <p>But now, over 30 kidnappings in, she's desperate. She wants to know if any of them might <em>still</em> be the guy she's looking for.</p>
        <p>Her logic is simple:</p>
        <p>The real male lead is the <strong>only man</strong> who has the highest possible beauty score.<br>She kidnapped a bunch of guys and recorded their scores.</br>Can you help her identify if there's <strong>only one</strong> possible male lead?</p>
      
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line contains an integer \( n \) \( (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) \), the number of kidnapped men.</p>
        <p>The second line contains \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \) \( (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) \), where \( a_i \) is the beauty score of the \( i \)-th kidnapped man.</p>
      
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>If the highest beauty score appears only once, print <code>Found him!</code> — he's probably the male lead.</p>
        <p>If multiple men share the top score, print <code>Who knows?</code> — she still has work to do.</p>
      
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p><strong>Input</strong></p>

91 85 97 88 97

        <p>On the quiet island of Rokkenjima, a heinous crime has been committed. There are \( n \) suspects numbered from 1 to \( n \). Each suspect gives an alibi by naming one person who they believe is innocent. Every suspect except the killer is named as innocent by at least one person.</p>
        <p>The heroine, Erika, arrives on the scene. Erika's task is to <strong>find the killer</strong> — the one who is never vouched for by anyone.</p>
      
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line contains an integer \( n \) \( (2 ≤ n ≤ 100)\) — the number of suspects.</p>
        <p>The second line contains \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, …, a_n \) \((1 ≤ a_i ≤ n)\), where \(a_i\) represents the suspect that the \(i\)-th suspect claims is innocent.</p>
      
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>Print a single integer — the number of the killer (i.e., the suspect who is never declared innocent by any other suspect). It is guaranteed that only one killer exists.</p>
      
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p><strong>Input</strong></p>
        <pre>4
2 3 1 1</pre>
      
        <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
        <pre>4</pre>
        
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>Suspects 1, 2, and 3 are declared innocent by someone. Only suspect 4 is not declared innocent by any suspect. Therefore, suspect 4 is the killer.</p>

        <p>Lloyd has been commissioned to solve a water crisis in Frontera, a bustling town on a 2D grid. The Queen has finally approved a project to dig a straight canal from the top of the city to the bottom, connecting the royal reservoir to the farmland.</p>
        <p>Lloyd must now choose a single column in the 2D city grid and demolish as few buildings (<code>#</code>) as possible in that column to create a clear vertical canal from the top to the bottom.</p>
        <p>You must help Lloyd determine the <strong>minimum number of demolitions</strong> required to make any one column fully diggable (i.e., turn all cells in that column into <code>.</code>). He doesn't care which column — he'll just pick the cheapest.</p>
      
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line contains two integers \(n\) and \(m\) \((1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100)\) — the number of rows and columns.</p>
        <p>The next \( n \) lines, each with a string of \( m \) characters, represent the city grid:<br><code>.</code> = empty land (no demolition needed)<br><code>#</code> = building (needs to be demolished)</p>

        <p>Elrise, fake saint and con-artist extraordinaire, has made it to the finale of the Grand Mages' Tournament. In the last trial, she must face off against multiple battle challenges, one after another.</p>
        <p>In each challenge, she is given a sequence of magical attacks represented by integers. She must respond with spells of equal or greater strength to survive.</p>
        <p>Before each challenge, she may rearrange her spells in any order. But she must use each spell exactly once, in some order, to block the enemy attacks—also one by one.</p>
        <p>Elrise will win the challenge only if she can <strong>block all enemy spells</strong>, such that:</p>
        <p>Each of her spells is ≥ the enemy spell at that turn.<br>Spells cannot be reused.<br>She must commit to a fixed order before the fight starts.</p>
      
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line contains an integer \( n \) \((1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) \), the number of spells in the challenge.</p>
        <p>The second line contains \( n \) integers \(e_1, e_2, ..., e_n\), where \(e_i\) is the power of the enemy spell.</p>
        <p>The third line contains \( n \) integers \(f_1, f_2, ..., f_n\), where \(f_i\) is the power of Elrise's spell \(i\).</p>

        <h2>Help: Standard Input/Output</h2>
        <p>
          In programming competitions, problems usually require you to read from <strong>standard input</strong> and write to <strong>standard output</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Standard Input?</h3>
        <p>
          This is the input your program reads from the console. You don't need to open any files or create a GUI. Just read using language-specific commands like <code>cin</code> (C++) or <code>input()</code> (Python).
        </p>

    
        <h3>What is Standard Output?</h3>
        <p>
          This is where your program writes its answers — again, through the console. Use commands like <code>cout</code> (C++) or <code>print()</code> (Python). Make sure the output matches the required format exactly.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Sample Problem:</h3>
        <p>Given two integers \( A \) and \( B \), print their sum.</p>
    
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <pre>3 4</pre>
    
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <pre>7</pre>
    
        <h3>Sample Solution Template</h3>
    
        <p><strong>In C++</strong></p>
        <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int A, B;
    cin >> A >> B; // Read two integers
    cout << A + B << endl; // Print their sum
    return 0;
}</pre>
      
        <p><strong>In Python</strong></p>
        <pre># Read input, split by space, convert to int
A, B = map(int, input().split())
print(A + B)</pre>
